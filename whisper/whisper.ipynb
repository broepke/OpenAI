So, basically, I was calling you because the land that you reserved online is a land without electricity. We had a problem with the reservation site, and that's why you booked a land without electricity, thinking it was a 50 ampere. So, we're sorry about that. That's why we're going to reimburse you for the difference, or simply make you another reservation on a land that does have a 50 ampere. So, don't hesitate to call us so we can complete that. Thank you. Have a good day.\")"
